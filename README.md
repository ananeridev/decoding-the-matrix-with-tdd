# Decoding the Matrix

The project aims to create a system that allows users to rent a reality inside of The Matrix.

* Use Case 01: The system will randomly choose an available reality from a specific category containing three different realities based on the user's request.

* Use Case 02: The system will calculate the final renting cost of the reality based on the number of days the user wants to rent and the age of the customer. The cost will be calculated using a formula that includes the cost per day, the tax based on the age of the customer, and the number of days the reality is rented. The final result will be printed in Brazilian Portuguese format as "R$ 244,40".

* Use Case 03: The system will register a renting transaction, including the customer data, the reality selected, the final cost, and the due date. The due date will be calculated based on the actual date and the delivery date of the reality, and it will be printed in Brazilian Portuguese format as "10 de Novembro de 2020".

**Overall, the project will provide a unique and immersive experience for fans of The Matrix film by allowing them to rent a reality inside of the movie's world. The system will be able to handle all aspects of the renting process, including selecting an available reality, calculating the final cost, and registering the transaction.**
